## What is this repository?

This repository contains Java solutions for the Little Book of Semaphores in their simplest form. Motivated by [COS40003](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/study/courses/units/Concurrent-Programming-COS40003/local) from Swinburne University, it's a really good way to learn about Semaphores without getting too bogged down by Java and its boilerplate.

If you're studying this unit or are interested in Concurrent Programming, I highly recommend you tackle this book in a language of your choice.
